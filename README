AsyncBlink is a small extention to Blinker and enables you to use
coroutines as receivers for your signals.

Install
=======

Installation is simple, via pip:

.. code-block:: python

   $ pip install asyncblink



Usage
=====

Usage is simple, too. Create a signal, connect some receivers to it
and then use the ``send()`` method to trigger all receivers

.. code-block:: python

   from asyncblink import signal
   my_signal = signal('nice-signal')

   @asyncio.coroutine
   def coro_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
       # an expensive io operation here
       return 'done'

   def receiver(sender):
       return 'ok'

   my_signal.connect(coro_receiver)
   my_signal.connect(receiver)
   my_signal.send('some-sender')


Using AsyncBlink with tornado coroutines
========================================

To use `tornado coroutines <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/gen.html>`_
pass a callable that schedules the execution of a future
using the parameter ``scheduler``:

.. code-block:: python

   from tornado import gen, ioloop

   @gen.coroutine
   def tornado_coro_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
       # do something
       return 'done'

   def scheduler(future):
        loop = ioloop.IOLoop.instance()
        loop.add_future(future, lambda f: f)
	return future

   my_signal.connect(tornado_coro_receiver, scheduler=scheduler)


Other than that, AsyncBlink's usage is the same as Blinker, Take a look at the
`Blinker documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/blinker/>`_ for further
information.
